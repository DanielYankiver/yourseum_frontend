# YOURSEUM

YOURSEUM is a React Application that takes your favorite masterpieces out of the museum and places them on your screen. You can select artworks to favorite and view them based on the order you selected them. While viewing these artworks you will see the name of the paining, the name of the artist, the year the painting was completed and a short description of it. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
